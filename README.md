 ### SQL SEQUENCE QUERY LANGUAGE
 ---
#### Introduction to SQL 
- SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
- It is used for storing and managing data in Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). 
- It is a standard language for Relational Database System. It enables a user to relate databases and tables. 
- All the RDBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS Access, and SQL Server use SQL as their standard database language.
- SQL allows users to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements

#### RULES OF SQL
- Structure query language is not case sensitive. Generally, keywords of SQL are written in uppercase. 
- Statements of SQL are dependent on text lines. We can use a single SQL statement on one or multiple text line. 
- Using the SQL statements, you can perform most of the actions in a database. 
- SQL depends on tuple relational calculus and relational algebra

  #### Databases
 A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a structured way to allow for easy access, 
retrieval, and manipulation. 
Advantage of Databases:
- Data Integrity: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data.
- Security: Protects data from unauthorized access and breaches.
- Backup and Recovery: Allows data to be recovered in case of loss or corruption
- Concurrency: Supports multiple users accessing the database simultaneously.
- Scalability: Ability to handle increasing amounts of data and users without performance degradation.
- Efficient Data Management: Databases are optimized for quick access to large volumes of data, enabling fast retrieval 
of information through queries

 #### How Databases Store Data
 Databases store data in a structured format using tables, which are composed of rows and columns. Each table 
represents a specific type of data, and each row (or record) in the table represents a single entry, such as a customer or 
transaction. The columns (or fields) define the attributes of the data, such as a customer’s name, age, or account 
number.
- If you have used Excel, you should already be familiar with tables
- Tables have rows and columns just like Excel.
- Database tables for instance are organized by column
- Each column must have a unique name, 
- You will notice, that some columns contain numbers, while other contain texts. In a spreadsheet, each cell can have its own data types.
- But in  databases tables, all the data in a column must be of the same type.
- This makes performing analysis on database tables pretty simples, while the data type must be consistent

 A few Key points about stored in SQL Databases
 1. Data in Databases is stored in tables that can be thought of just like  Excel spreadsheets.
 2. All the data in the same column must match in terms of data type.
 3. Consistent columns types are one of the main reasons working with databases is fast.: Often databases hold a LOT 
of data. So, knowing that the columns are all of the same type of data means that obtaining data from a database 
can still be fast

#### ADVANTAGE OF SQL
There are some major advantages to using traditional relational databases, which we interact with using SQL. 
The five most apparent are:
 1. SQL is easy to understand.
 2. Traditional databases allow us to access data directly.
 3. Traditional databases allow us to audit and replicate our data.
 4. SQL is a great tool for analyzing multiple tables at once.
 5. SQL allows you to analyze more complex questions than dashboard tools.

#### Basic SQL Command 
- SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database.
- It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data. 
- SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set permission 
for users.
 #### Types of SQL Commands 
There are five types of SQL commands: 
1. DDL: Data Definition Language
DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc. 
All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database
- Create: It is used to create a new table in the database.
- Drop: It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
- Alter: It is used to alter the structure of the database. This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
- Truncate: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table. 
##### Here are some commands that come under DDL:
- CREATE 
- ALTER
- DROP
- TRUNCATE

2. DML: Data Manipulation Language
- DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all form of CHANGES in the database. 
- The command of DML is not auto-committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.
#### Here are some commands that come under DML: 
- INSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.
- UPDATE: This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.
- DELETE: The delete statement is used to delete existing records in a tabl
 
3. DCL: Data Control Language
  DCL commands are used to GRANT and TAKE BACK authority from any database user.
#### Here are some commands that come under DCL: 
- Grant: It is used to give user access privileges to a database. 
- Revoke: It is used to take back permissions from the user
 
4. TCL: Transaction Control Language
TCL commands are used to manage transactions in the database. These are used to manage the changes made DML Statement (INSERT, DELETE and UPDATE only). It also allows statements to be grouped into logical transactions
#### Here are some commands that come under TCL
- COMMIT: Commit command is used to permanently  save any transaction.Commit command is used to save all the transactions to the database. 
Example: DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25
         COMMIT;
- Rollback:This command restores the database to last committed state Rollback command is used to undo transactions that have not already been saved to the database. 
Example: DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE AGE = 25;
 ROLLBACK;
- Savepoint: It is used to roll the transaction back to a certain point without rolling back the entire transaction. Savepoint command is used to temporarily save a transaction so that you can rollback to that point whenever necessary.

5. DQL: Data Query Language
DQL is used to fetch the data from the database. It uses only one command.
- Select: This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra. It is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause
-  Syntax: SELECT expressions FROM TABLES WHERE conditions; 
Example: SELECT emp_name FROM employee WHERE age > 20

###  SQL Data Types 
SQL Datatype is used to define the values that a column can contain.Every column is required to have a name and data type in the database table. 
- String Datatype allow us to store a group of characters, enclosed in single quotes, in a record of a table column. These characters can be; numerals, letters, symbols etc. E.g: Char, Varchar, nchar, Varbinary, nvarchar
- Numeric Datatype: are one of the most widely used data type in SQL. They are used to store numeric values only.  E.g,  Bit, tinyint, smallint, int, bigint, decimal, money, float,  real etc 
- Date Datatype are used in SQL for values to be stored in date. E.g: Date, Datetime, Timestamp.
- Binary Datatype E.g: Yes/No, True/False

###  SQL Keys
In SQL, Keys are special fields in a table that help;Create relationships between tables,Maintain uniqueness and Ensure data is consistent and valid.
- Primary Key: A special type of key that uniquely identifies each record in a table. Each table can have only one primary key Example: Employee_id in the Employee table.
- Foreign Key:A field in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.Example: Employee_id in the Salary table is a foreign key (FK) that references the Employee_id in the Employee table (PK)
- Surrogate Key: A surrogate key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, typically created by the database itself (e.g an autoincrementing integer)
 #### Surrogate Key Vs Primary Key
 Primary Key can have a real meaning, like Driving License, Matric No, while surrogate key is usually auto-incrementing integer with no real meaning.
- Composite Key:Composite key (also known as compound key concatenated key) is a group of two or more columns that identifies each row of a table uniquely.
 Example: In salary tables, Employee_id and Salary_month_year are combined to identify each row uniquely in salary table
- Candidate Key:Candidate key is a key of a table which can be selected as primary key. A table can have multiple candidate keys, out of which one can be selected as a primary key. Example: Employee_id, License_Number, and Passport_Number
- Alternate key: Alternate key is a candidate key, currently not selected as a primary key of the tableExample: License_Number and Passport_Number

#### SQL Operators  
An SQL operator is a reserved words or a character used primarily in an SQL statement's WHERE clause to perform operation(s), such as comparisons and arithmetic operations. These Operators are used to specify conditions in an SQL statement and to serve as conjunctions for multiple conditions in a statement. E.g;
1. Arithmetic Operator
2. Comparison Operator
3. Logical Operator

 #### SQL Clauses 
SQL clauses are essential components of SQL (Structured Query Language) that define how queries interact with the database. They are used to specify conditions, modify data, and control how results are returned. Here’s an overview of some of the most common SQL clauses .
- Group BY Clause: SQL GROUP BY statement is used to arrange identical data into groups. 
2. The GROUP BY statement is used with the SQL SELECT statement. 
3. The GROUP BY statement follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause. 
4.The GROUP BY statement is used with aggregation function
- Having Clause: HAVING clause is used to specify a search condition for a group or an aggregate. 
2. Having is used in a GROUP BY clause. If you are not using GROUP BY clause then you can use HAVING function like a WHERE clause 
-Order BY: The ORDER BY clause sorts the result-set in ascending or descending order. 
2. It sorts the records in ascending order by default. DESC keyword is used to sort the records in descending order.
  
#### SQL Aggregate Functions
SQL aggregate functions are powerful tools used to perform calculations on a set of values, returning a single value that summarizes the data. They are commonly used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to group the data by one or more columns before applying the aggregate function.
1. COUNT()Purpose: Counts the number of rows in a result set or the number of non-null values in a column.
 Example: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees; SELECT COUNT(department) FROM employees;
 Use: Useful for finding the total number of records or counting non-null values in a column.
2. SUM()Purpose:Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
 Example: SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees; Use: Adds up all the values in a numeric column.
3. AVG()Purpose:Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
 Example: SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees;Use: Returns the mean of the values in a numeric column.
4. MIN()Purpose:Returns the smallest (minimum) value in a column.
 Example: SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
 Use: Finds the lowest value in a column.
 5. MAX()Purpose:Returns the largest (maximum) value in a column.
 Example: SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees; Use: Finds the highest value in a column.

#### SQL Joins
SQL JOIN means "to combine two or more tables". In SQL, JOIN clause is used to combine the records from two or more 
tables in a database.
- INNER JOIN :In SQL, INNER JOIN selects records that have matching values in both tables as long as the condition is satisfied. It returns the combination of all rows from 
both the tables where the condition satisfies. 
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT FROM EMPLOYEE 
INNER JOIN 
PROJECT ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID
- LEFT JOIN :The SQL left join returns all the values from left table and the matching values from the right table. If there is no matching join value, it will return NULL.
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT FROM EMPLOYEE 
LEFT JOIN 
PROJECT ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID
- RIGHT JOIN: In SQL, RIGHT JOIN returns all the values from the values from the rows of right table and the matched values from the left table. If there is no matching in both tables, it will return NULL.
-  SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT FROM EMPLOYEE
RIGHT JOIN 
PROJECT ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID
- FULL JOIN :In SQL, FULL JOIN is the result of a combination of both left and right outerjoin. Join tables have all the records from both tables. It puts NULL on the place of matches not found.
SELECT EMPLOYEE.EMP_NAME, PROJECT.DEPARTMENT FROM EMPLOYEE 
FULL JOIN 
PROJECT ON PROJECT.EMP_ID = EMPLOYEE.EMP_ID

#### SQL Set Operation
SQL set operations allow you to combine the results of two or more SELECT queries. These operations treat the result sets of each query as mathematical sets, enabling you to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference on them. 
SQL provides the following set operations
- Union Operation
The SQL Union operation is used to combine the result of two or more SQL SELECT queries.
In the union operation, all the number of datatype and columns must be same in both the tables on which UNION operation is being applied.
The union operation eliminates the duplicate rows from its result set.
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 
UNION
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
- Union All: Combines the results of two or more SELECT queries but does not remove duplicates.
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 
UNION ALL 
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
- Intersect Operation
It is used to combine two SELECT statements. The Intersect operation returns the common rows from the SELECT statements.
In the Intersect operation, the number of datatype and columns must be the same.
It has no duplicates, and it arranges the data in ascending order by default.
 SELECT name FROM employees 
INTERSECT 
SELECT name FROM clients;

#### View in SQL
An SQL View is a virtual table that is created based on the result set of a SQL query. Unlike a regular table, a view does not 
store data itself; instead, it dynamically retrieves data from one or more underlying tables whenever the view is queried.
 1. A view behaves like a table in SQL, allowing you to select, update, insert, and delete data (with some limitations).
 2. The data in a view is not stored physically; it is generated dynamically when the view is accessed.
 3. A view is defined using a SELECT statement that can join multiple tables, filter rows, and select specific columns.Security
 4. Views can be used to restrict access to certain data in a table by exposing only specific columns or rows to the user.
  For example, you can create a view that only shows certain fields of a sensitive table, hiding the rest from the user.
 - Simplicity
 1. Views simplify complex queries. Instead of writing a complex query repeatedly, you can create a view and use it as a 
simple table.
 2. This is particularly useful in applications where complex logic needs to be reused

#### SQL CASE WHEN STATEMENT
The CASE WHEN statement in SQL is a conditional expression that allows you to create different outputs based on certain conditions. It is similar to the IF-THEN-ELSE logic in programming languages.
This statement is often used to implement logic directly within SQL queries, making them more dynamic and adaptable to different scenarios.
SELECT 
product_name,
category_id
WHEN 1 THEN 'Electronics'
WHEN 2 THEN 'Furniture'
WHEN 3 THEN 'Clothing'
ELSE 'Other'
END AS category_name
FROM products;
 In this example, the CASE statement checks the category_id of each product and returns the corresponding category 
name. 
If category_id is 1, it returns 'Electronics’;
 if 2, it returns 'Furniture’; 
and so on.

#### Key Points
- Flexibility: CASE can be used in SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and ORDER BY clauses, making it very versatile..
- Readability:CASE statements can make your SQL queries more readable by replacing nested IF statements.
- Efficiency: Even though CASE adds some complexity to your queries, it often improves efficiency by reducing the need for multiple queries or conditional logic in your application code

#### Power BI Comparison with Other BI Tools
There are many Business Intelligence tools such as Tableau, Power BI and SSRS among others but a major competitive value as a result of market evaluation exist between Power BI and Tableau and some of this arguments will be highlighted below.

#### Power BI - Data Modelling
Data Modeling is one of the features used to connect multiple data sources in BI tool using a relationship. A relationship defines how data sources are connected with each
other and you can create interesting data visualizations on multiple data sources.
This allows businesses to define new metrics and to perform custom calculations for those metrics.

#### Power BI – Environment
- Data View
When you go to the Data tab, you can see all the data as per the defined relationship from the data sources.
- Relationship/ Model View
In the Relationship tab, you can see the relationship between data sources. When you add multiple data sources to Power BI visualization, the tool automatically tries to detect the relationship between the columns. When you navigate to the Relationship tab, you can view the relationship. You can also create a relationship between
the columns using the Create Relationships option.

#### Power BI - Visualization Options
- Creating Simple Visualizations
Visualizations are used to effectively present your data and are the basic building blocks of any business intelligence tool. Power BI contains various default data
visualization components that include simple bar charts to pie charts to maps, and also complex models such as waterfalls, funnels, gauges, and many other components.
In Power BI, you can create visualization in two ways. First is by adding from the right side pane to Report Canvas. By default, it is the table type visualization, which is selected in Power BI. Another way is to drag the fields from right side bar to the axis and value axis under Visualization. You can add multiple fields to each axis as per the requirement.
In Power BI, it is also possible to move your visualization on the reporting canvas by clicking and then dragging it. 
- STEP 1: DEFINE QUESTIONS & GOALS
- STEP 2: COLLECT DATA
- STEP 3: DATA WRANGLING
- STEP 4: DETERMINE ANALYSIS
- STEP 5: INTERPRET RESULTS

#### DAX FUNCTIONS
DAX FUNCTIONS: DATA ANALYSIS EXPRESSIONS
DAX functions play an important role in the usage of DAX for data modeling and reporting. It is an inbuilt function provided in the DAX language that helps you perform commonly used data calculations on the Data Model. DAX has additional functions that are designed to work with relational data and perform dynamic aggregation.
DAX is a formula language and is a collection of functions, operators, and constants that can be used in a formula or expression to calculate and return one or more values. DAX is the formula language associated with the Data Model of Microsoft Excel Power Pivot and with Microsoft Power BI.
However, it is a formula language that allows the users to define custom calculations in calculated columns and calculated fields (also known as measures).
DAX helps you create new information from the existing data in your data model.

- Excel Functions vs. DAX Functions
Similarities Between Excel Functions and DAX Functions
Certain DAX functions have the same name and the same general behavior as Excel functions.
DAX has lookup functions that are similar to the array and vector lookup functions in Excel.
Differences Between Excel Functions and DAX Functions DAX functions have been modified to take different types of inputs and some of the DAX functions might return a different data type. Hence, you need to understand the usage of these functions separately though they have the same name.
You cannot use DAX functions in an Excel formula or use Excel functions in DAX formula, without the required modifications.
Excel functions take a cell reference or a range of cells as a reference. DAX functions nevertake a cell reference or a range of cells as a reference, but instead take a column or table as a reference.
Excel date and time functions return an integer that represents a date as a serial number.
DAX date and time functions return a datetime data type that is in DAX but not in Excel
